          There is lot of resources to look into if you don't know how to build
          a flow in the Rodened editor. A good place to start is our editor that
          is free to try at <a href="https://nodered.rodened.io"
          target="_blank">https://nodered.rodened.io</a>. There is a number of
          examples that we have put togeheter that uses no programming and also
          one example showing how to use and install python packages. The cloud
          based editor is set up in the same way as your own subscription will
          be. On the NODE-RED home page there is a <a
          href="https://discourse.nodered.org/" target="_blank">Discourse
          </a>forum which is an excellent place to search for answers and ask
          questions and also a <a href="https://nodered.org/slack/"
          target="_blank">Slack</a> forum.  Example flows (1379) and nodes
          (2361) can easily be found at <a href="https://flows.nodered.org/"
          target="_blank">the flows menu on nodered.org</a> <a
          href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/node-red"
          target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a> could also be a source for
          information if you have a more specific question.
